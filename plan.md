# Rust Learning Path: Beginner to Intermediate (4-6 Months)

## Goal
Attain **intermediate proficiency in Rust** by **March or April 2026**.

## Time Commitment
Approximately **4 hours per week** (study + hands-on practice).

---

## Core Learning Strategy
This path is tailored for someone with a strong C/C++ background who learns best by doing. We'll balance quick theoretical skims with intensive hands-on practice, reinforced by regular, spaced review weeks.

## Important Considerations for Your Learning

* **Prioritize Ownership & Borrowing:** This is non-negotiable. If you rush it, you'll constantly fight the compiler. Embrace the compile errors as learning opportunities.
* **Patience is Key:** Rust has a steeper initial learning curve than many other languages, but it pays off with fewer runtime bugs and higher confidence in your code. Don't get discouraged by the borrow checker; it's your friend!
* **Embrace Compiler Errors:** Rust's compiler errors are famously helpful. Read them carefully; they often tell you exactly what's wrong and suggest how to fix it.
* **Small, Focused Projects:** Instead of one single, massive project, tackle many small, focused projects. Each one helps reinforce different aspects of the language.
* **Keep Comparing to C/C++:** Your background is a huge asset. Continuously analyze how Rust's solutions differ from C/C++ and appreciate the trade-offs and benefits.
